# My Untitled Game
## What is this?
I have decided to write my own text-based, fantasy role playing game, my reasoning for this being nothing more than challenging myself and learning more
A lot of the focus on my own skill development here is around a rigid approach to object-oriented techniques
## Technical Information
I am building this project using C#/.NET - the reasoning for this is primarily to enforce the above OOP focus, but also to give me the ability to easily expand the scope using existing .NET frameworks as needed
My current focus is on writing the code for the fundamental aspects of the game, such as:
* Characters
* Items
* Locations

Following this and successful testing of these elements and their interactivity, my next main steps will be to setup a suitable game-state tracking system and a method of user-input parsing - again I am choosing to do this myself over use of excisting resources as the primary aim of this endevour is learning!
## The Creative Side
Currently as the game is in (very) early stages, a lot of the more creative side is not yet set out
### Characters
However, one aspect that has been created here is the main races of the game world - which will be the bulk of NPCs and from which the player chooses one to be
A brief outline of the races is below - a more in depth one will come:
* Altrian - a Human race who are wide spread on the world, they are a broad skilled and cosmopolitan race.
* Sylvanari - an Elven race from rich woodland and jungle regions, they are agile and skilled in defensive and illusionary magics.
* Brugrak - An Orcish race from tropical and highly volcanic regions, they share an elemental connection to the World, especailly to fire. Skilled combatants and masters of enchanting weapons.
* Dravok - A traditional Dwarven race living in great caverns under mountains. Skilled in metal craft and use of one-handed weapons, as well as some natural magical afinity.
* Emberforge - A wise, nomadic Dwarven race, master crafters and keen skill in alchemy they are a highly resilient race.
* Astrai - a powerful Elven race immensily gifted in the arcane arts. They shun what they see as lesser races and consider themselves connected to the Gods, they are rarely seen outside the ancient floating cities which they inhabit.

### Weapons
Weapons in the game will be split into ranged and melee (ranged currently not started)
Melee has the following possible materials:
* Stone
* Iron
* Steel
* Elven Steel
* Dwarven Steel
* Obsidean
* Silver
